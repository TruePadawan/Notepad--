## Logs
* Supports syntax highlighting for Qt/C++
* Pastebin plugin added

## Notes
<p>If you're building the program from source, you need to have OpenSSL installed on your computer, and it's bin directory in your Path(environment variables) or you can just add it scoped to the program itself if you don't want to put it directly into your system env variables</p>
